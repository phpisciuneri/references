  Abstract                 = {Present regulations in terms of pollutant emissions, noise and economical constraints, require new approaches and designs in the fields of energy supply and transportation. It is now well established that the next breakthrough will come from a better understanding of unsteady flow effects and by considering the entire system and not only isolated components. However, these aspects are still not well taken into account by the numerical approaches or understood whatever the design stage considered. The main challenge is essentially due to the computational requirements inferred by such complex systems if it is to be simulated by use of supercomputers. This paper shows how new challenges can be addressed by using parallel computing platforms for distinct elements of a more complex systems as encountered in aeronautical applications. Based on numerical simulations performed with modern aerodynamic and reactive flow solvers, this work underlines the interest of high-performance computing for solving flow in complex industrial configurations such as aircrafts, combustion chambers and turbomachines. Performance indicators related to parallel computing efficiency are presented, showing that establishing fair criterions is a difficult task for complex industrial applications. Examples of numerical simulations performed in industrial systems are also described with a particular interest for the computational time and the potential design improvements obtained with high-fidelity and multi-physics computing methods. These simulations use either unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navierâ€“Stokes methods or large eddy simulation and deal with turbulent unsteady flows, such as coupled flow phenomena (thermo-acoustic instabilities, buffet, etc). Some examples of the difficulties with grid generation and data analysis are also presented when dealing with these complex industrial applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Most of the energy produced worldwide comes from the combustion of fossil fuels. In the context of global climate changes and dramatically decreasing resources, there is a critical need for optimizing the process of burning, especially in the field of gas turbines. Unfortunately, new designs for efficient combustion are prone to destructive thermo-acoustic instabilities. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is a promising tool to predict turbulent reacting flows in complex industrial configurations and explore the mechanisms triggering the coupling between acoustics and combustion. In the particular field of annular combustion chambers, these instabilities usually take the form of azimuthal modes. To predict these modes, one must compute the full combustion chamber comprising all sectors, which remained out of reach until very recently and the development of massively parallel computers. A fully compressible, multi-species reactive Navier-Stokes solver is used on up to 4096 BlueGene/P CPUs for two designs of a full annular helicopter chamber. Results show evidence of self-established azimuthal modes for the two cases but with different energy containing limit-cycles. Mesh dependency is checked with grids comprising 38 and 93 million tetrahedra. The fact that the two grid predictions yield similar flow topologies and limit-cycles enforces the ability of LES to discriminate design changes.},
