  abstract = {An algorithm for the simulation of the evolution of slightly entangled
	quantum states has been recently proposed as a tool to study time-dependent
	phenomena in one-dimensional quantum systems. Its key feature is
	a time-evolving block-decimation (TEBD) procedure to identify and
	dynamically update the relevant, conveniently small, subregion of
	the otherwise exponentially large Hilbert space. Potential applications
	of the TEBD algorithm are the simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians,
	transport in quantum systems far from equilibrium and dissipative
	quantum mechanics. In this paper we translate the TEBD algorithm
	into the language of matrix product states in order to both highlight
	and exploit its resemblances to the widely used density-matrix renormalization-group
	(DMRG) algorithms. The TEBD algorithm, being based on updating a
	matrix product state in time, is very accessible to the DMRG community
	and it can be enhanced by using well-known DMRG techniques, for instance
	in the event of good quantum numbers. More importantly, we show how
	it can be simply incorporated into existing DMRG implementations
	to produce a remarkably effective and versatile 'adaptive time-dependent
	DMRG' variant, that we also test and compare to previous proposals.},

	theory of fault tolerance in quantum computation that may give concrete
	direction to future work in the development of superconducting qubit
	systems. The basics of quantum error-correction codes, which I will
	briefly review, have not significantly changed since their introduction
	15 years ago. But an interesting picture has emerged of an efficient
	use of these codes that may put fault-tolerant operation within reach.
	It is now understood that two-dimensional surface codes, close relatives
	of the original toric code of Kitaev, can be adapted as shown by
	Raussendorf and Harrington to effectively perform logical gate operations
	in a very simple planar architecture, with error thresholds for fault-tolerant
	operation simulated to be 0.75\%. This architecture uses topological
	ideas in its functioning, but it is not 'topological quantum computation'‚Äîthere
	are no non-abelian anyons in sight. I offer some speculations on
	the crucial pieces of superconducting hardware that could be demonstrated
	in the next couple of years that would be clear stepping stones towards
	this surface-code architecture.},

  abstract = {Quantum computers promise to exceed the computational efficiency of
	ordinary classical machines because quantum algorithms allow the
	execution of certain tasks in fewer steps. But practical implementation
	of these machines poses a formidable challenge. Here I present a
	scheme for implementing a quantum-mechanical computer. Information
	is encoded onto the nuclear spins of donor atoms in doped silicon
	electronic devices. Logical operations on individual spins are performed
	using externally applied electric fields, and spin measurements are
	made using currents of spin-polarized electrons. The realization
	of such a computer is dependent on future refinements of conventional
	silicon electronics.},

	lattice gases, (iv) lattice gases in "artificial'' magnetic fields,

	basic units of quantum information, are critical steps in the development
	of a quantum computer. Among the possibilities in the solid state,
	a defect in diamond known as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV(-1)) center
	stands out for its robustness--its quantum state can be initialized,
	manipulated, and measured with high fidelity at room temperature.
	Here we describe how to systematically identify other deep center
	defects with similar quantum-mechanical properties. We present a
	list of physical criteria that these centers and their hosts should
	meet and explain how these requirements can be used in conjunction
	with electronic structure theory to intelligently sort through candidate
	defect systems. To illustrate these points in detail, we compare
	electronic structure calculations of the NV(-1) center in diamond
	with those of several deep centers in 4H silicon carbide (SiC). We
	then discuss the proposed criteria for similar defects in other tetrahedrally
	coordinated semiconductors.},

  abstract = {The manipulation of electric charge in bulk semiconductors and their
	heterostructures is the basis of nearly all modern electronic and
	opto-electronic devices. Recent studies of spin-dependent phenomena
	in semiconductors open the door to technologies that harness the
	spin of the electron in semiconductor devices. In addition to providing
	spin-dependent analogies that extend existing electronic devices
	into the realm of semiconductor "spintronics," the spin degree of
	freedom also offers prospects for fundamentally new functionality
	in the quantum domain, ranging from storage to computation. This
	is likely to play a crucial role in the information technologies
	in the 21st century. This book, written by a team of experts, provides
	an overview of emerging concepts in this rapidly developing field.
	The topics range from spin transport and injection in semiconductors
	and their heterostructures to coherent processes and computation
	in semiconductor quantum structures and microcavities.},
